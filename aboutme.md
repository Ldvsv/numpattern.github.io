My name is Harold Velasquez. I have the following qualities:

- I have a B.Sc. in Geological Engineering from Peru
- I definitevely enjoy going out to:
 * Camping
 * Jogging
 * Surfing
 * Traveling
 * Gym 
 * Drinking a cold beer when it's hot out there  
 
 I mean not in that priority order because I love all of them

What else do you need to know about me?

_My history_

Honestly, I am a guy who loves to study so much all fields related to mathematics and programming.
