My name is Harold Velasquez, a M.Sc. student in Geostatistics at the University of Alberta. I spent some years in the mining industry as a geologist. 


**What is my motivation doing this?**

I would like to start a huge community where we all can share our experiences and knowloedge in data science and promote the usage of computer science in order to improve processes in different industries.

**What exactly will be the topics in my page?**

Well, at first I am posting very basic subjects such as starting in jupyter and making some affordable statistic analysis. I think that it is necessary to get a first sight of the fundamentals. In the near future new topics will be on board like geostatistics, optimization methods, non parametric statistics, bigdata, stochastic programming, parallel computing and programming in other languages like Julia.

If you want to contact me, feel free to email me at **harold.velasquez.s@uni.pe** or click on the share-links available on the footer of my pages to follow me on social media.
