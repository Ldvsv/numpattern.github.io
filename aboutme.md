My name is Harold Velasquez. I have the following qualities:

- I have a B.Sc. in Geological Engineering from Peru
- I definitevely enjoy going out to _camping, jogging, surfing, traveling, gym and drinking a good cold beer when it's hot out there_ . I mean not in that priority order because I love all of them. I am always opened to share experiences and try new things.

What else do you need to know about me?

_My history_

Honestly, I am a guy who loves to study so much all fields related to mathematics and programming.
